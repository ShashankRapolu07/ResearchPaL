## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1
User Query:
How does DeepSeek-R1 improve reinforcement learning efficiency for reasoning tasks?

Retrieved Context:
DeepSeek-R1 improves reinforcement learning efficiency by employing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) instead of traditional critic-based methods. GRPO eliminates the need for a separate critic model, estimating baselines from grouped rewards instead. This allows for more efficient optimization by reducing computational costs and improving stability in reinforcement learning updates. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 incorporates reasoning-specific reward functions such as accuracy rewards and format rewards, which enforce structured reasoning outputs. Unlike earlier models, DeepSeek-R1 applies multi-stage RL with an intermediate cold-start phase, using pre-collected reasoning examples to stabilize initial training.

Agent Response:
DeepSeek-R1 enhances reinforcement learning efficiency by utilizing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which eliminates the need for a critic model and instead estimates baselines using grouped rewards.

Follow-Up Questions: (Questions based on Retrieved Context not answered by Agent. These questions must be answerable from the paper!) [each question enclosed in \"\" double quotes; no \' must be included in any question]
["How do reasoning-specific reward functions impact the learning dynamics of DeepSeek-R1?", "What role does the cold-start phase play in stabilizing reinforcement learning for DeepSeek-R1?", "How does multi-stage reinforcement learning improve reasoning capabilities compared to single-stage approaches?", "What are the trade-offs of using GRPO instead of traditional critic-based RL methods?", "How does DeepSeek-R1 prevent instability during RL training while optimizing for reasoning performance?"]

### Example 2
User Query:
How does OmniParser enhance GUI agent capabilities in detecting interactable regions?

Retrieved Context:
OmniParser employs a finetuned interactable region detection model that extracts UI elements, such as icons and buttons, from screenshots without relying on parsed HTML. It curates a 67k-image dataset, extracting bounding boxes directly from DOM trees of popular webpages. The detection module integrates OCR-based text extraction to label UI components more accurately. By merging these bounding boxes with numeric IDs, OmniParser improves action grounding and selection accuracy. The model removes redundant bounding boxes, reducing prediction errors and making interactions more precise.

Agent Response:
OmniParser improves GUI agent performance by using a finetuned detection model to identify interactable regions without requiring HTML parsing. It overlays bounding boxes with unique numeric IDs, enhancing UI element recognition and interaction accuracy.

Follow-Up Questions: (Questions based on Retrieved Context not answered by Agent. These questions must be answerable from the paper!) [each question enclosed in \"\" double quotes; no \' must be included in any question]
["What preprocessing techniques were applied to construct OmniParser’s 67k-image interactable region dataset?", "How does OmniParser’s detection model handle overlapping or redundant bounding boxes?", "What role does OCR-based text extraction play in improving GUI action selection?", "How does OmniParser compare to other non-HTML-based interactable region detection methods?", "What challenges arise when extracting bounding boxes from DOM trees for UI element detection?"]
